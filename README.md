# Advent of Code 2017 - Solutions of Problems

My solutions to the problems of the [Advent of Code 2017](https://adventofcode.com/2017) advent calendar.

**Running the solutions** The solutions work out of the box with any standard up-to-date PHP installation. Just execute the script. The puzzle solution is given as an output to the console or browser window, depending on where you run the script.
